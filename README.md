# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis

In this project, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted on a dataset containing measurements of tannin content and astringency for 37 red wines. The dataset included three key variables: MCP (tannin content measured with the methyl cellulose-based method), HA (tannin content measured with the bovine serum albumin-based method), and astringency (rated on a scale from 1 to 9 by expert tasters).

The analysis involved several cases to explore the relationship between MCP, HA, and astringency:

Case 1: A simple linear regression of astringency on MCP was performed. The model's R-squared value and the equation of the line were calculated.

Case 2: A simple linear regression of astringency on the natural logarithm of MCP was carried out. The model's R-squared value and the equation of the line were determined, and the results were compared to Case 1.

Case 3: A simple linear regression of the exponential of astringency on MCP was conducted. The model's equation and R-squared value were calculated.

Case 4: A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between MCP, HA, and astringency. Hypothesis testing, including the F-test, was conducted to assess the significance of the multiple linear regression model. The results indicated that the model is statistically significant and that MCP has a significant relationship with astringency, whereas HA does not exhibit a significant relationship.

Finally, a correlation matrix was generated, showing the relationships between MCP, HA, and astringency. It was observed that both MCP and HA were positively correlated with astringency, with MCP exhibiting a slightly stronger positive correlation.

In conclusion, this project provided a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between tannin content, astringency, and the various regression models used. It highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate transformations for dependent and independent variables and demonstrated how multiple linear regression can reveal significant relationships between variables.
